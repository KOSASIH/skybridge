# CelestiaNet Architecture

## Overview

CelestiaNet is a decentralized network for secure and efficient data transfer. The architecture is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and fault-tolerant system for data transmission.

## Components

### Node

The Node component is responsible for data transmission and reception. It consists of the following sub-components:

* **Data Handler**: Handles data transmission and reception
* **Network Manager**: Manages network connections and routing
* **Security Module**: Provides encryption and decryption services

### Satellite

The Satellite component is responsible for data relay and transmission. It consists of the following sub-components:

* **Data Relay**: Relays data between nodes
* **Transceiver**: Transmits and receives data
* **Ground Station**: Provides connectivity to the ground station network

## Interactions

The Node and Satellite components interact through the following interfaces:

* **Data Transmission Interface**: Used for data transmission between nodes and satellites
* **Network Interface**: Used for network communication between nodes and satellites

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

The architecture is designed to provide high-performance data transmission, with a target throughput of 100 Mbps.

### Security

The architecture provides end-to-end encryption and decryption services to ensure secure data transmission.

### Scalability

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally, with the ability to add or remove nodes and satellites as needed.

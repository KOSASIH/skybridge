# Overview

Skybridge is a decentralized data transfer protocol that enables secure and efficient data transfer between nodes on the CelestiaNet network. CelestiaNet is a revolutionary, next-generation network infrastructure project that unifies the world through a seamless, high-speed, and secure connectivity platform.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the core codebase, tools, and resources for building and deploying the CelestiaNet network, including the Pi Network and Starlink satellite integration.

## Features

* **Decentralized**: Skybridge is a decentralized protocol that operates on a network of nodes, ensuring that there is no single point of failure.
* **Secure**: Skybridge provides end-to-end encryption and decryption services to ensure secure data transmission.
* **Scalable**: Skybridge is designed to scale horizontally, with the ability to add or remove nodes as needed.
* **Efficient**: Skybridge is optimized for high-performance data transmission, with a target throughput of 100 Mbps.
